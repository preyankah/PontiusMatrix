Current thoughts: 

A new table is needed for each plot.
Plots a-d are generated using csv files (See the png file in each plot folder).

Next step will be using pandas and exsiting pontipy functions to create new tables that have the ideal format for each plot. (Due date: 11/25/2020)


After that, anotations functions will be added to plots. (Due date:
